      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Hi, I'm Andr√©s Villarroel, a co-founder of nacionvirtual.cl a very good and different hosting, and let me ask you something, 
          Are you tired of the classic web hostings where you pay for the space and you don't see them to the next payment? 
          And then you need to hire someone every time you have a problem with your pages?. I was tired too, so I have a very good solution, 
          a WordPress site hosting that you paid annually, with beautiful layouts to choose and we prepare your entire site! 
          and that is not all, for the same money you have monthly support so you can ask to change details like a couple of images, 
          paragraphs, your logo, a little new section, etc. 
          With our service, In just 5 steps you have a beautiful Response Design Website for your enterprise. Do you want to see the beautiful layouts?</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>The audience for our service is any entrepreneur or small/middle enterprise looking for help to implement 
          a new WordPress website, or who is looking for a hosting to migrate their actual WordPress website. 
          These customers would be generally whos don't have an IT department or any person to see this kind of topic, 
          so they need to ask an external partner every time they need to do changes to the pages on their own websites. 
          With our services, all those changes will be done by our team, because they could ask those to us monthly 
          (one time per month)</p>  <!-- change this -->

Get to know the details of our line of Web services
Afraid of hosting that only gives you the space and you have to manage alone? 
<br><br>
In addition to creating or moving your site in our hosting, WE HELP YOU WITH THE CHANGES you have later. The service includes basic monthly support, so once a month you can ask us for minor changes to your site if you need it, and we also take care of wordpress support by keeping your plugins updated.
<br><br>
Company Website
We can do everything with the domain you already have, and if you don't have one we buy and configure it for you.
<br><br>
ANNUAL SUBSCRIPTION
The services include:

We'll always stay with you, as you can request minor changes once a month, free of charge.
If you need an informative WEB site, that looks modern and shows the most relevant aspects of your company or venture (like most sites), and you don't have a ready-made design, then we can offer a website based on one of our more than 200 templates: https://www.elegantthemes.com/layouts
(All have view for cell phone, tablet and computer).
You can choose the one that best suits you (or a combination of them), or ask us to propose some according to your type of business and style (formal, colorful, etc).
Once you choose one, we ask for 25% of the value and we start working on that template (adapting it to your requirements and placing the material that you send us:
The description of your business or company
The description of your services/products
Your photos, videos and logo if you have them.
The links of your social networks
etc.
<br>
Also includes:
The domain's DNS settings
The implementation of the site
Hosting on our Amazon AWS server
Possibility of requesting minor changes once a month (change texts, add or change images, add a section, modify some colors, etc.)
Constant support of WordPress and its plugins
Self-administration key, if you require it.
 

NOTE: If you don't have a domain yet, we can buy it for you, and that value will be added to the value of the subscription (.cl domains cost 10 thousand a year, you can check it at nic.cl).

        E-Commerce (or Online Store)
Do you need to sell your products? We set up your own online store with a shopping cart where your customers can pay you with any RedCompra card
<br><br>
YOUR ONLINE STORE
The service includes:

If what you need is an E-commerce (Online Store), in which you can sell products or services, we will do it. We also use templates to create the E-commerce.
After setting up the site, we teach them how to manage it in two training sessions (and we leave a selection of guide videos) so that they learn how to manage their store.
If you want to offer online payment with REDCOMPRA, we enable Mercado Pago, which provides this service, without the need to hire it at Transbank.
If you want direct dealings with Transbank, you must contract it yourself (we cannot contract it for you, since Transbank does not allow us to do it for your company), but once contracted, we set it up on site, at an extra cost.
